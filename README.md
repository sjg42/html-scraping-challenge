# html-scraping-challenge
In this challenge, the goal was to scrape data off of a given url and conduct analysis on the data. I was given two skeleton files (part1 and part2), and given two challenges:

1) Find the article titles and previews within the url given in part1
2) Scrape the data from the url given in part 2, clean it, and answer questions about Mars temperatures and pressures.
